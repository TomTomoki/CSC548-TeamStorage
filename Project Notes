Goal: â€œDevelops the collection device that aggregates all of the data from the microbits, and uploads the data to a server" 
-- Needed: 1 Working Project Director, 1 Python Programmer, 1 Database Specialist, 1 Web Programmer

What needs to be done:
- Get data from the centralized micro bit through the bluetooth connection
  - Talk/communicate with the micro bit... If the data is not being sent, contact someone/send some signal to the micro bit administrator
- Store data in the database

Tasks:
- Get the detailed data format(decimal points, data type, ...etc)/how often the data is sent
- Research on how to get data from the micro bit through bluetooth
- Decide how to store the data ... on database? on laptop?

Use Cases:
- Store data in the database
- View stored data

SCRUM Requirements Meeting Notes:
- Hardware needed
  - Laptop/microbit
- Software needed
  - MongoDB
  - Python Shell
- Tasks/Subtasks/Plans
  - Design the database (Logan/Parker)
  - Build the database (Logan/Parker)
  - learn how to pull data from the microbit (Ruby/Tomoki)
  - Format data (Ruby/Tomoki)
  - Add data to tables (All)
  - Figure out the data the other groups will get (Tomoki)
- Items to purchase
  - None

Final Design:
Since we know that we will receive only 4 digit integers as inputs in all three scenarios, we will test various data-input frequencies
and the database storage volume, and that will be our test for all three scenarios.
- Data Input Frequency/Speed Constraints
The centralized microbit can take inputs up to every 2 milliseconds and send the data to our laptop without any data loss,
and the data can be stored in our database.
- Database Storaga Volume
Using MongoDB, our database is stored internally/locally on our computer so we can expand the storage size as needed.

To do after the senario is chosen:
- Figure out how to tell which sensor the data is coming from and if the data should be stored or ignored
  - ID...If the enter time is wrong, cancel the exit time with the ID.
- Final data format decisions
- Time function ... When to check the time? When they sense the person entering? OR when our laptop recieves the data?
