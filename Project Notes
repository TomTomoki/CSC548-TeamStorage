Goal: â€œDevelops the collection device that aggregates all of the data from the microbits, and uploads the data to a server" 
-- Needed: 1 Working Project Director, 1 Python Programmer, 1 Database Specialist, 1 Web Programmer

What needs to be done:
- Get data from the centralized micro bit through the bluetooth connection
  - Talk/communicate with the micro bit... If the data is not being sent, contact someone/send some signal to the micro bit administrator
- Store data in the database

Tasks:
- Get the detailed data format(decimal points, data type, ...etc)/how often the data is sent
- Research on how to get data from the micro bit through bluetooth
- Decide how to store the data ... on database? on laptop?

Use Cases:
- Store data in the database
- View stored data

SCRUM Requirements Meeting Notes:
- Hardware needed
  - Laptop/microbit
- Software needed
  - MongoDB
  - Python Shell
- Tasks/Subtasks/Plans
  - Design the database (Logan/Parker)
  - Build the database (Logan/Parker)
  - learn how to pull data from the microbit (Ruby/Tomoki)
  - Format data (Ruby/Tomoki)
  - Add data to tables (All)
  - Figure out the data the other groups will get (Tomoki)
- Items to purchase
  - None

Final Design:
Since we know that we will receive only 4 digit integers as inputs, we will test various data input frequencies
and the database storage volume, and that will be the test for all three scenarios.
- Data Input Frequency Limitation
- Database Storaga Volume
